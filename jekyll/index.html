              We know it too. Let’s work together to build an environment that enables <em>your people</em> to realize their full potential.

                  Our sweet spot is startups who have hit their stride and are now crossing the boundary into small-to-medium business territory. We show up in support of those who want their organization to grow and evolve without losing their authenticity. We serve those who have good intent and need a new breed of tools and resources to overcome this new set of challenges. We’re here for those leveraging aggressive growth to actualize their mission, vision, and purpose. For us, the most meaningful engagements are with those who perceive they have great people and recognize those people have latent potential that hasn’t yet been realized.
                </p>
                <p>
                  We’re a team of learners and experimenters; we're passionate about helping others create lasting, meaningful value. We come from organizations small and not so small. We’ve been in the trenches of individual contribution, at the leadership table, developing teams as managers, and driving change efforts org-wide. We always show up curious and ready to listen. We come with open minds and a toolbox of approaches, disciplines, philosophies, and methodologies–none of which will be exactly right for you, but that’s the point. We’re here to help you cultivate a system from which the full force of your organization will emerge.
