Now more than ever, employee engagement is the focus of people operations and HR initiatives as far as the eye can see. Organizations taking a human-centric approach to business have realized that helping people feel more engaged at work improves their employee experience, sense of fulfillment, and personal growth. Organizations with a more conventional “single bottom line” approach to business are realizing that increased employee engagement leads to higher productivity and [better business outcomes](https://www.cultureamp.com/resources/guides/foundation-guides/why-employee-engagement-matters.html).

But humans are complex, so the story isn’t quite that simple. There’s another side to employee engagement that should be accounted for if overall employee health and wellbeing is a first-class goal. 

Imagine, for a minute, your journey through a favorite hobby or activity. You’re passionate about it, and heavily invested in participating, progressing, and excelling at it. In short, you’re highly engaged. As a result, you invest time, energy, and other resources into getting better. You work hard to improve, to increase your knowledge and skill, to reach the next level of aptitude. And in return for all that trouble, you get fulfillment, satisfaction, and pride. You find yourself in a reinforcing feedback loop of desire, effort, success, and fulfillment–a feedback loop that carries you upward into new realms of performance and satisfaction. 

Imagine what we could achieve if our entire organization felt this way at work. And think of the positive impact our organization would have on our people! 

“Great!”, you may be thinking, “Full speed ahead into employee engagement!”.

Ah, but wait just a minute. Think again of that activity about which you’re so passionate. Consider what would happen if someone or something gets in the way of your success in that activity–something like bureaucracy or politics or someone in a position of power with whom you disagree. Consider what would happen if something outside of your control undermines your success, undermines the actualization of your passion.

If your improvement, choice, or sense of belonging (or any other [core need](https://www.palomamedina.com/biceps/)) is undermined in a context you aren’t particularly engaged in, it isn’t the end of the world. You’ll probably just resign yourself to the trials and tribulations of “the grind” and invest your discretionary energy into what you are passionate about. But what if those core needs aren’t met when you are deeply engaged and passionate? Your reaction will likely be much more intense; we’d do well not to forget that passion can amplify negative feelings just as well as positive ones. 

This is the peril of engagement. As engagement increases, so too does the possibility for more intense frustration and disappointment. If we ask employees to care deeply about their work, we must also realize that systemic friction and unmet needs will be exponentially more distracting, more painful, and more demoralizing. If we want employees to engage in fulfilling their potential, we must be ready to offer them the necessary support to apply that engagement toward positive outcomes. Otherwise, we shouldn’t be surprised to see positivity, productivity, and fulfillment transformed into anger, frustration, burnout, and churn. But if we do cultivate an organization in which engagement begets joy? The results will be extraordinary–for the business and for the people.
