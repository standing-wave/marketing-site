## Philosophy
<span class="image left"><img src="{{ "/images/connections.jpg" | absolute_url }}" alt="" /></span>
We believe that the potential of any organization resides within the people who comprise it–in people’s connection to each other and engagement in their work. We believe that latent potential can only be realized by the people themselves. We seek to support that process by taking the time to understand the larger context, staying curious, helping hold the space for crucial conversations, sharing principles as well as methods, and keeping the creation of real, long-term value as everyone’s shared focus. We bring a healthy respect for the complexity of sociotechnical systems, and focus intently on vision / culture level outcomes instead of rigid, myopic implementations.
